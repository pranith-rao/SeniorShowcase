# StartUp Profit Prediction Using ML
In this internship I had to build a ML model that predicts the profit that a startup can earn based on R&D, Marketing and Administration Expenses. ML code is present in the Jupyter notebook attached.  
I have integrated the ML model into a flask app so that results can be displayed on a well designed clean UI.
