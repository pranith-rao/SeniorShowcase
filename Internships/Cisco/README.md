# Cisco-Internship
In this internship, we were asked to complete three courses, namely Introduction to Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Essentials, and Packet Tracer.  
Following that, we were tasked with applying our knowledge and creating a demo network connection for our college using the Packet Tracer UI. The .pkt file for the network connection is included in the folder, and screenshots of the process can be found in the Presentation pdf.
