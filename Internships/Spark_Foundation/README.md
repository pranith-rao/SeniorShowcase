# Spark Foundation - Web Development Internship
In this internship I was given 2 problem statements and asked to build separate websites using the technologies of my choice.  
First one was to build to banking website without any login system or anything just to present how transactions are handled among the customers and in the second way I had to integrate a payment gateway. Description for both the problem statments can be found in their respective folders!  
For both the websites I used PHP for the backend and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the frontend.
